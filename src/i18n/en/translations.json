It stipulates that only this agent is authorized to handle the transaction.\n\nSuch an agreement offers advantages for both parties:\n\nThe owner receives maximum market exposure through targeted marketing of the property.\nThe agent invests more resources into marketing, knowing they are the sole recipient of the commission.\nThe property is not listed by multiple agents simultaneously, reducing the risk of price distortions or fraudulent offers.\nLegal Basis and Terms\n● The duration of an exclusive brokerage agreement is typically between 3 and 6 months.\n● Early termination is usually only possible under specific conditions, such as the agent failing to fulfill their obligations.\n● After the contract expires, the owner may choose to extend the contract or sell/rent the property independently or through other agents.\n\nExample for Austria:\n○ If an agent is engaged under an exclusive brokerage agreement, the owner cannot sell or rent the property independently without paying the agent the agreed commission.\n○ If the agent fails to find a buyer or tenant within the contract period, the agreement expires without cost to the owner.\n○ The agent's commission is only payable upon successful completion of the transaction.\n\nResponsible Authority: The Austrian Chamber of Commerce or the respective real estate regulatory authority."

However, the specifics of Austrian law must be taken into account.\n\nWho is allowed to acquire and use specific land plots (real estate) is regulated in Austria under the Land Transfer Act.\n\nAustrian land transfer laws are enacted at the state level, meaning there are 9 different versions corresponding to the number of federal states.\n\nThe Federal Land Transfer Act distinguishes 4 types of land transactions:\n\t1. Agricultural and forestry land transactions (green land transactions)\n\t2. Transactions involving building plots (gray land transactions)\n\t3. Foreign land transactions\n\t4. Transactions involving sea surfaces (blue land transactions)\n\nForeign land transactions.\nIf foreigners acquire ownership or co-ownership of real estate, an official permit is generally required. However, there are exceptions for citizens of EU and EEA member states; these individuals are treated as locals and do not require approval.\n\nFor nationals of third countries, a permit procedure is usually required. In some cases, citizens of certain third countries can acquire real estate without a permit based on bilateral agreements. In such cases, confirmation is required to ensure that no permit is needed.\n\nNationals of third countries are considered to be those from countries that are neither members of the European Union (EU) nor signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\nThe approval process can take between 3 and 6 months and involves additional costs.\n\nExample for Vienna (as of 21.04.2024):\n•\tApproval issuance:\no\t76.30 euros administrative fee per applicant for acquiring ownership (co-ownership)\no\t47.23 euros administrative fee per applicant for acquiring a personal servitude right (e.g., applying for a right of residence and use for a family member)\n•\tLegal force clause:\no\t3.27 euros administrative fee\no\t14.30 euros federal fee\n•\tFederal fees:\no\t14.30 euros per application for each applicant and registration number\no\t3.90 euros per attached document copy per page (maximum 21.80 euros)\n\nCompetent authority: The office of the respective state government or the respective district administrative authority.\n"

The goal is to reduce financial burdens on tenants.\n\nThis regulation has the following effects:\n\nTenants do not have to pay brokerage fees unless they have hired the agent themselves.\nLandlords cover the agent’s costs if they hire a broker to find tenants.\nFairness and transparency in the real estate market are promoted since the cost burden lies with the client.\nLegal Basis and Application\n● The Ordering Principle primarily applies to rental apartments.\n● It does not apply to property purchases, where buyers can still be required to pay brokerage fees.\n● Violations of the principle can result in fines.\n\nExample for Austria and Germany:\n○ A tenant is looking for an apartment and contacts a real estate agent. Since the agent is working on behalf of the landlord, the tenant does not have to pay a commission.\n○ However, if the tenant hires an agent independently to find a property, they must cover the agent’s fees.\n○ Landlords attempting to pass brokerage costs onto tenants are acting illegally.\n\nResponsible Authority: The respective tenant protection organization or real estate regulatory authority."

          "question": "How can I buy a property?",
          "answer": "To sell your property, you will generally need a current land register extract, an energy certificate, building plans and floor plans, as well as, if necessary, rental agreements and evidence of renovations carried out. These documents help make the sales process smooth. So you are well prepared."

        "documents-need-to-sell-property": {
          "question": "What documents do I need to sell my property?",
          "answer": "When selling your property, you need several important documents. One of the key documents is an extract from the land register, which proves your ownership. Additionally, an energy certificate is legally required to provide information about the property's energy efficiency. If available, you should also have construction plans and floor plans, as they help potential buyers better understand the layout of the property.\n\nIf you have carried out any renovations or modernizations in the past, it is useful to provide proof of these works. If the property is currently rented, you will also need rental agreements and an overview of the utility bills.\n\nTo ensure you have all the necessary documents, it is advisable to check with the relevant authorities or consult a real estate agent in advance."

          "question": "How do I find the best rental offers near me?",
          "answer": "To find the best rental offers in your area, there are several effective strategies. One of the easiest ways is to use online real estate portals, where you can filter listings based on price, size, and amenities. Popular platforms include Zillow, Apartments.com, and Craigslist.\n\nAdditionally, contacting local real estate agents can be very useful, as they often have exclusive rental listings that are not publicly advertised online. Checking local newspaper ads or looking for \"For Rent\" signs in your neighborhood can also help you discover hidden gems.\n\nAnother great option is to explore social media platforms or local Facebook groups, where landlords often post available rentals. You can also create your own post stating what kind of property you are looking for, which might attract potential landlords.\n\nIf you want to secure a rental quickly, it's important to check new listings frequently and contact the landlord as soon as possible to schedule a viewing."
        },
        "costs-associated-property": {
          "question": "What costs are associated with buying a property?",
          "answer": "When purchasing a property, there are additional costs beyond the purchase price that buyers should be aware of. One of the most significant is the real estate transfer tax, which varies by region and typically ranges between 3.5% and 6.5% of the purchase price. Additionally, notary and land registry fees usually amount to 1.5% to 2% of the total cost.\n\nIf you hire a real estate agent, you may need to pay a broker's commission, which is typically between 3% and 7% of the property's price, depending on the agreement and location. You should also factor in potential renovation, modernization, or moving expenses.\n\nFinancing a property can also come with extra costs, such as bank processing fees or early repayment penalties if you decide to pay off a loan ahead of schedule. After the purchase, ongoing expenses like property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs should also be considered.\n\nIt is advisable to calculate all these costs in advance and seek advice from a financial expert or real estate professional to ensure a well-planned investment."
        },
        "how-arrange-viewing-appointment": {
          "question": "How can I arrange a viewing appointment?",
          "answer": "There are several ways to schedule a property viewing. In most cases, you can contact the seller or landlord directly through the real estate platform where the listing was published. Many online portals provide a contact form or a direct phone number for the seller or real estate agent.\n\nIf the property is listed through an agent, you can reach out via phone or email to arrange a suitable appointment. It’s advisable to suggest multiple time slots to increase the chances of securing a viewing.\n\nIf you found a property through a newspaper ad or a \"For Sale\" or \"For Rent\" sign, you can call the owner directly or visit the location to inquire about a viewing.\n\nBefore the appointment, it's a good idea to prepare a list of important questions about the property. If you’re looking to rent, having documents such as a tenant self-disclosure form, proof of income, or a credit report ready can improve your chances of getting the property."

This withdrawal can be declared up until the contract is concluded or within 14 days thereafter. The period begins with the delivery of a document that includes at least the name and address of the entrepreneur, the necessary contract identification details, and instructions on the right of withdrawal, the withdrawal period, and the procedure for exercising the right of withdrawal, but not before the contract is concluded. In the case of purchase contracts for goods, the period starts when the consumer takes possession of the goods.\n\nIf such a document is not provided, the consumer has a right of withdrawal for a period of twelve months and 14 days from the contract conclusion or delivery of goods. If the entrepreneur subsequently provides the document within these twelve months, the extended withdrawal period ends 14 days after the consumer receives the document.\n\nThe consumer does not have the right of withdrawal:\n1. if they initiated the business relationship with the entrepreneur or their representative for the purpose of concluding this contract,\n2. if no prior discussion took place between the parties or their representatives before the contract was concluded, or\n3. for contracts where both parties' services must be rendered immediately, if they are typically concluded outside business premises and the agreed amount does not exceed 25 euros, or if the business is not operated in permanent premises and the amount does not exceed 50 euros, or\n4. for contracts subject to the Distance and Off-Premises Contracts Act or the Insurance Contract Act.\n\nThere is no specific form required for the withdrawal declaration. The withdrawal period is met if the withdrawal declaration is sent within the deadline."

You may use the attached sample withdrawal form, but it is not mandatory.\n\nTo meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send the notification of exercising your right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period expires.\n\nConsequences of Withdrawal:\nIf you withdraw from this contract, we will refund all payments received from you, including delivery costs (except for additional costs incurred if you chose a type of delivery other than the cheapest standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and at the latest within fourteen days from the day on which we received notice of your withdrawal from this contract. For this refund, we will use the same payment method that you used in the original transaction unless expressly agreed otherwise; in no case will you be charged fees for this refund.\n\nIf you requested that the services begin during the withdrawal period, you must pay us a reasonable amount corresponding to the proportion of the services already provided up to the time you inform us of your withdrawal, relative to the full scope of the services stipulated in the contract.\n\nNo Right of Withdrawal:\nWarning: Your right of withdrawal expires prematurely if we have fully performed the service owed and only started execution after you expressly agreed to it and at the same time confirmed your knowledge that you would lose your right of withdrawal upon complete fulfillment of the contract. The service from fylpi is considered fully rendered upon activation.\n\nThe customer may deactivate their advertisement (or additional product, service, etc.) at any time before the agreed period ends. However, this does not constitute a withdrawal under KSchG or FAGG. The customer remains obliged to pay the full agreed fee."
